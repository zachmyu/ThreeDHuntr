      { userId: 5, printerId: 2, review: `The Creality Ender-3 Pro 3d printer is my first 3D printer. I purchased it as I have previously 'played' with CAD packages and been frustrated at not being able to physically handle the fruits of my labor. I saw this purchase as the move from imagination to reality (or Creality). I was not disappointed. On arrival and opening the box I also thought, like all the reviews that I had read/watched, that it was very well packaged. With only the instructions from the box It took me about 2 hours to build, I definitely think I could have managed it quicker but I was working on other things in parallel. I powered the unit up, mounted some filament, inserted the SD card, selected the dog model, and hit print. WOW, so easy, ALL of my family have been amazed at the results. It has been printing boxes, filament guides, vases, etc for 3 days now without a break, even printing my own 3D design which I pulled together with one of the wells know print packages.`, },
      { userId: 6, printerId: 3, review: `I received my Creality Ender-3 3d printer about two weeks ago and it arrived in perfect condition. After carefully assembling it and leveling the bed following some YouTube videos, I printed my first Benchy! It printed outstanding, with nice quality! Since then, each of my prints has printed flawlessly. Needless to say, I am very happy with this purchase, and Creality has designed and manufactured a great printer at a very reasonable price! The key to success is to carefully assemble it using great resources online and on YouTube. There is a huge population of Creality users online and most are more than happy to help.`, },
      { userId: 6, printerId: 4, review: `I did the research for a goo Quality Price printer, so I get to the Creality Ender-3 3d printer. I had some troubles with the assemble, instructions are not really easy, but not that hard, have a picture of the finished product near, after that and the trick o using an A4 paper to level, I started printing and the results are great, easy to use good results. I'm very satisfied with it`, },
      { userId: 7, printerId: 5, review: `One of the most appealing features of the Creality Ender-3 is its incredibly low price point. While the cost slightly varies depending on the provider you purchase it from, this 3D printer can currently be found for under $199. At the moment, in some online stores, the Creality Ender-3 is cheaper than its predecessor, aptly named the Ender 2. The differences in design between the Creality Ender-3 and Ender 2 are slight, but still worth mentioning. The latest iteration still retains its CR-10 vibe, with aluminum extrusions comprising the frame and a single leadscrew driving the Z-axis from the left-hand side of the frame. However, unlike its forebear, which featured a cantilever style that left the X-axis rail projecting into thin air, the Creality Ender-3 completes the loop and closes the frame out.`, },
      { userId: 8, printerId: 6, review: `I bought this as an upgrade from the Ender 3 Pro and couldn't have been happier. The build volume is much better for larger prints. Shame it doesn't come with a mean well power supply and silent board as this would have made it the perfect printer. I ordered the upgraded silent board straight away and what a difference :) Shame about the fans now but compared to before, massive difference. This is the only upgrade I have done and it has worked perfectly as is. I don't see the need for any more upgrades and would recommend it if you want to print bigger. I will get a new Ender 3 V2 when they are back in stock as I sold my other and regret it. Worth having 2 printers on the go to save time. I printed the Lego Man on it and looks great.`, },
      { userId: 8, printerId: 7, review: `I am currently printing Covid-19 face masks for healthcare professionals and both this printer and my Ender 3 are currently dedicated to this, running 7 days a week, 16 hours a day, and sometimes longer, for the last two months. Other than replacing the extruder with a cheap all-metal unit, fitting the Creality silent board, and replacing the lead screw brass bearings with cheap Delrin bearings (to remove z-axis backlash) the printer is running stock. The only real gripe I have is that after discovering Octoprint introduces artifacts even when hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4, I'm back to printing from SD. The problem here is that unlike the Ender 3, the Ender 5 + stock firmware doesn't have a refresh SD option. If you add a standard SD to micro SD adapter cable like I did with the E3, then if you change the SD card the printer doesn't pick this up and the lack of a refresh option means you can't update the list of files to print without unplugging and replugging the adapter cable into the controller board - which kind of negates the whole purpose. If Creality could add this feature I'd be overjoyed. The only other problem I've had is that sometimes I'll get a temperature trip warning during hot-end warm up to 255 degrees. This I think is a firmware issue because if I heat the hotend to 240 then 250 then 255 I don't get the error - and I've never had it fail during printing either. The print quality is excellent. The slight Y-axis ringing on the Ender 3 which is a consequence of the large moving Y bed mass (with a glass plate fitted) is not evident on the Ender 5 and the solidity of the mechanical design is excellent - I think this is clearly the way to build large-format printers. Bed stability and flatness are very good. Using a 25mm square piece of 0.5mm thick thermal silicone sheet in each corner, you do not need any clips to secure the glass plate.`, },
      { userId: 9, printerId: 8, review: `Love this printer,I cant leave it alone.i started printing and setting it up as soon as I received it. I still have some fine tuning to do but I will get there. I would recommend these printers to any one interested in printing`, },
      { userId: 9, printerId: 9, review: `This was my second 3D printer. The first was supposed to be for beginners. Didn’t work and couldn’t fix it. The Ender 5 Pro worked right away. The only thing i added was a strain relief for the heated bed cabling and a roll of 6”(15cm) blue painter’s tape for the bed. Enjoying my time working from home with my new Ender 5 Pro making stuff for the house. I even made pieces for breathing masks. Now going to try PETG.`, },
      { userId: 10, printerId: 10, review: `Initially, I had a rough start with this printer. I took my time and assembled it properly. Bed leveling took a little time, but I got it dialed in and started sending test prints for further tweaking. The printer began rebooting and freezing mid-print. Since I am a 3d printing newb, I notified Creality about the issue. While I waiting for a reply, I determined that the included flash drive was failing. The G-code data would literally stop mid-print because the card was failing reads. I replaced the card and all is well now. Creality was fast to respond as well. It's been a few weeks and I am hooked now. My family is hooked. Co-workers too. The quality I am getting from my prints is amazing and it is a lot of fun. 3D printing is no longer just a curiosity for me. This will probably be a life long hobby now thanks to my Ender 5. I highly recommend this printer.`, },
      { userId: 10, printerId: 11, review: `The printer was very easy to assemble and got it running in no time. I had a little bit of trouble leveling the bed, though mostly because I didn’t know what exactly is expected (this is my first 3D printer). After trials and errors and the bed leveled, printing is a breeze. Printing quality is excellent, much better than most printouts people shared on the net. Overall very satisfied with this printer!!`, },
      { userId: 11, printerId: 12, review: `These upgrades are well received. Note there is also a fully upgraded hot end with a fan duct to cool the filament on extrusion. Bargain price for an upgraded, already awesome machine!`, },
      { userId: 11, printerId: 13, review: `Disregard those who say this is not an upgrade. How many companies look at what the community did with their product and then release the newer version with many of the mods already incorporated without raising the price point. The Ender 3 is a budget printer with an output quality which rivals the Prusa for a fraction of the cost. The stock tubing and hot-end on the Ender 3 pro have worked great for me with a simple setup and simple interface. No need to add fluff if it works. Get the Prusa Slicer and get to making!`, },
      { userId: 12, printerId: 14, review: `So I've been wanting a 3D printer for some time. Many of my colleagues at work have been building and working with them for years and I've always been interested but I didn't want the first generation made of Plexi or having to cut each wire. I wanted a strong and easy to learn printer. I found it in the Ender-3 V2. I made a few errors putting it together but after re-reading the instructions I was able to get it together. The best part is that it worked well out of the box. Now even though this was my first printer I have A LOT of time waiting for the printer to come as it was a pre-order and I watched A LOT of YouTube videos on tips and tricks. With a little bit of self-education on bed leveling and slicers, a little searching on Thingiverse, and a bit of trial and error I was able to produce some nice prints.`, },
      { userId: 12, printerId: 15, review: `After weeks of debugging why print quality is bad in the middle and reading forums, I realize that my bed is warped in the middle. Each corners are properly leveled but the middle portion of the bed is lower than the edges leading to bad adhesion. I have to do small prints in the corner to be able to properly print, highly frustrating!`, },
      { userId: 13, printerId: 16, review: `Fair warning... you WILL need to print off several upgrade parts. (free) However there are some upgrades you will be likely to purchase to make this change from a great machine to an AMAZING machine. (BLtouch autobed leveling, Glass bed, metal filament feeder, etc.`, },
      { userId: 13, printerId: 17, review: `This was my first experience with 3D printing so I was very unsure of what I should buy. I did a lot of research and the Creality name kept showing up, especially the Ender 3 and Ender 3 Pro. When I found this Ender 3 V2 and read the reviews about the printer and especially the good comments about the seller I decided to take the plunge. I have not regretted it for one minute. I have been blown away with the quality prints and the relative ease of use. Of course, as I said, I did a lot of research before purchasing so I ordered an all-metal extruder and capricorn tubing at the same time I ordered the printer. I installed them on the printer from the beginning so I can't say if they helped anything or not but I have had no problems whatsoever with the printer. I could not be more pleased. I setup a Raspberry PI as an Octoprint print server early in the process because I didn't like inserting and removing the sdcard so often and feared it might eventually cause problems with the card slot, not to mention the time it takes. That has made the printing process much simpler and and quicker by allowing me to send gcode files directly from CURA. I would not hesitate to purchase another one should the need arise.`, },
      { userId: 14, printerId: 18, review: `I recently purchased a Prusa3d printer kit which was three times the price of this so I was suitably skeptical but when I received the package I was pleasantly surprised. For a noob it'll be a bit frustrating because the instructions were basic but think it through and it'll make sense and there are a good number of youtube videos to watch to resolve any build challenges. Took me about 90 minutes of careful construction (compared to 8+ for the Prusa3d but that has a 100+ page build manual).`, },
      { userId: 14, printerId: 19, review: `Bought this for myself for Christmas, It arrived on the eve early enough that I could assemble it before work. it came with all the tools required, screws, washers, Allen wrenches in a few sizes and fold out instructions. The instructions were clear but I still got confused. Grab a youtube video to assist you in putting it together as somethings are better to do out of order to save a headache down the line. It took about an hour ina half to get it put together and fired up, I loaded the test filament and did a quick leveling of the print bed using a piece of paper [youtube will show you how Ender 3 bed leveling]. Once leveled properly I hopped on Thingiverse to grab a free 3d model to print, something small [a coral statue] and used it. The coral statue I printed was advanced enough to let me see the various ways it prints with its various pointed pillars and arching points. It proved to be much better in my opinion than the original doggo miniature that came pre loaded as a test.`, },
      { userId: 15, printerId: 20, review: `A bit of a pain setting up as some screws had to be left reasonable loose and others tightened firmly. Choose this 3D printer as it was a good brand and there are plenty youtube vids and forums to help out with any questions or queries. Once it was all set up and had updated the firmware started printing away with the pla filament that came with the printer without any issuses.`, },
      { userId: 15, printerId: 21, review: `Bed adhesion was not that good at first but this was fixed by slightly increasing the extrusion rate and cleaning / very lightly sanding the glass bed with fine sand paper. If it wasn’t for this would be 5 stars. Have since got newer bed upgrade and adhesion is no longer an issue. ( small prints with low bed area still need raft)`, },
      { userId: 16, printerId: 22, review: `Very happy with this printer decided to get the Ender3 V2 rather than the CR6-SE and I'm glad I did with all the teething issues you hear and it costing more, found more fun and finding out more doing upgrades to the printer on the go, Next I think Octoprint 🙂 if your thinking of buying not had an issue yet but I always keep an eye on the prints worthwhile getting a baby cam or webcam to monitor from your phone.`, },
      { userId: 16, printerId: 23, review: `Over all the Ender 3 V2 is a good printer, but I would not suggest this to people new to printing. You will need to trouble shoot a lot of problems within the first 30 days and spend more money to fix this issue. First week in the bed would not stay level from print to print. Had to buy new springs. That solved the issue. Second week one of the fans makes a horrible noise. I took the hot end cover off to see if any dust or filament was in there. There wasn't. It sounds like one of the fans had bad bearings. I'm just going to wait till that completely dies to replace, but untill them it is really really noisy. Next about a month in the extruder arm cracked and I had to buy a replacement. Basically many of the parts on this thing are subpar and you will have to replace them sooner than later. If you are looking for something that just works, you might want to look elsewhere. If you want to save some money or enjoy constantly having to tinker with something, then this might be the printer for you.`, },
      { userId: 17, printerId: 24, review: `I bought this printer from a recommendation from a friend. He suggested the V2 upgrade over the older style Ender 3. It was well worth the extra $40 or $50. The newer motherboard apparently is silent compared to other models. I have nothing to compare to, but I can assure the only noise this thing makes is from the fan. I mean, it makes some very quiet mechanical noises from the motors turning, but honestly they're barely audible at all. The glass bed is also great to have. This is my first ever printer, so again I have nothing to compare to, but the glass bed is super easy to use. If a print isn't adhering, a quick scrub with dish soap and a rinse, then no issues. The controller is super easy to use, with a nice size display. Plus, it is a pretty popular printer, so there's TONS of videos, support, and of course STL models for all kinds of upgrades and modifications for it. I replaced the smooth control knob with a printed one with a coarse design for better grip, added a filament guide, a Z axis screw knob to easily raise the print head, a tool holder, and even a bracket for an inductive sensor to enable auto bed leveling. I highly recommend buying some better bed springs, as any time I moved the printer (I don't have a permanent spot for it just yet) required manual leveling. Or get an inductive sensor for cheap and make it an auto leveler. Even as it comes stock, this printer is great. It has every tool you need to assemble and maintain it, a micro USB card and reader, extra nozzle, extra bowden tube, and a nice little drawer under the print bed for all the tools! I've been printing nearly every day for two weeks now, and I just love using this printer. My friend who recommended it has two other brands/models, and is now envious and thinking of getting one of these for himself.`, },

Nothing too complicated, and there are many walk-throughs on YouTube, that can guide you through the entire process. Its not a must, but having some experience with tools and a bit of problem solving skills will help you out a lot. By the time you're done, you'll have a grasp on how your printer works, which is important when it comes to using and maintaining it.`, },

Using geometry, planes, and extrude tools, you'll be able to model anything you want in real life, or anything you could possibly think of...`, },
      { userId: 19, printerId: 2, review: `Not sure if I got lucky or if I am a natural at setting up 3D printers. Using the tiny print instructions and a really bad youtube video I was eventually able to get the printer assembled. I had to take the Y bar and top bar off and reinstall them because the wires were on the wrong sides. The Z limit switch also took a few tries to get right, T-nuts suck. I installed the wrong firmware twice but finally actually read the file names and facepalmed figured out that it came with the right firmware and reinstalled that. Anyway, the first print came out perfect. I mean I couldn't find a flaw. Second, much more complex print failed, because way complex, but worked the second try and looks great. Every video or review I watched or read before I got this made me believe that I would have to spend days tweaking it to work right but, like I said, I either got really lucky or setting up 3D printers is my super power. Either way, this thing is freaking amazing right out the box. There are also lots of mods you can do to it to make it better too.`, },
      { userId: 19, printerId: 3, review: `I no longer fear Hell, for I have followed the instructions in assembling this monster. 6 hours of putting parts together, taking them apart because, oh no, this or that is the wrong part, or backwards. Lots of similar looking parts that are either not clearly labeled or the instructions do not take the time in distinguishing too much. This was a nightmare. Not even sure if it's working now. Assembled, on, been auto-homing for 10 minutes now with no movement. This might have been a mistake... Trust me, if you get this, find a YouTube setup and follow it instead. Much warmer, and you'll be much happier if you do.`, },
      { userId: 20, printerId: 4, review: `I bought this printer mainly due to the entry level price point and the fact that it was the 'v2'  so it had to be better than the original, right? Well, yes and no. Turns out there is a problem with the 4.2.2 mother boards and many users (see Creality's own forum) have had issues with the stepper drivers overheating and causing layer shifting. After running several tests for Creality's warranty department and wasting half a roll of filament, I was fed up. I contacted Comgrow instead and they sent out a new 4.2.7 board and cooling fan. This board fixed all the issues and the printer now works wonderfully.`, },
      { userId: 20, printerId: 5, review: `Cons: The OS is new and lacks some basic features. If I take out the memory card to upload new files I then have to power cycle the unit because there is no way to re-initialize the micro SD card. They forgot to add that. I like the new OS though. Just waiting on them to finish it up. The screen is not touch-screen like the ad mentions. The printer prints fine and is worth the money for the upgrades you get. The unit is pretty much silent except for the PSU fan. It’s the same PSU from the Ender Pro. So far I give this a 8.5/10. I will be adding BL Touch next because the glass is slightly warped in the middle. Flipping the glass to the other side fixed it until my BL Touch arrives. It’s still cheaper than the CR-6 with that added.`, },

Would have been much faster if I had watched the video on the sd card, but I didn't notice the sd card until I was already printing. I had never done any 3-d printing before and it turns out that the model I chose should have had supports, but the parts of it that printed looked really great. In the future I'm going to use a supports add-on for cura instead of the default slicer that comes with this. I'm surprised how cheap, easy and fun this thing is. I hope it lasts a long time. I gave it 4 stars in the "easy to assemble" category because it's kind of difficult to get the little nuts that hook behind the tracks to turn when you can't see them. I don't know if there's a better way to do that but it was kind of annoying. Everything else was pretty straight forward and I was able to do without properly reading the instructions apparently.`, },

During assembly make sure your bed rolls smoothly and doesn’t catch in spots and isn’t wobbly. If either is the case loosen the wheels at the bottom, make sure the wheels spin well and then slowly tighten them like lug nuts (eg alternating from front right to rear left). Also to the same to X axis. Check that X-axis gantry with a level.`, },

There is a white USB/SD card in the box, put it in computer open the install video and watch that before and while assembling the printer. I tried to follow the paper instructions without knowing about the video install guide. The paper instructions are not detailed enough by themselves. Using only the paper install guide I had to take apart and reassemble the unit several times to fix upside down or backward installed pieces and there was a lot of head scratching and it took forever. The video assembly answered most questions I had and resolved (most) of the confusion. It was hard to level the platform, leveling is very finicky. It was hard to thread the filament into the nylon tube (the video cuts as they thread the filament, you need to twist the filament sometimes to get it to enter the extruder hole). I wish the sample PLA filament was on a spool, it is just loose and has tangled several times printing my first piece. I am printing it outside of the enclosure, there is fan noise and some motor noises while it prints. Hopefully the enclosure makes it even more quiet. It is fun to watch while the printer creates items.`, },

After adjusting all of the retraction and temperature settings I could and cleaning the nozzle thoroughly, I decided to switch the nozzle out for the spare in case there was a clog. Using the right size socket and applying almost no pressure on the cold nozzle on my first 1/4 turn the extruder head snapped clean off. The nozzle is literally sheared in two and I have no way to get the piece inside the extruder out. Like I said, it worked great at first but now it's completely worthless.

      { userId: 29, printerId: 23, review: `I'm in the middle of a big project so I've been running it 18hrs/day for the past few weeks and it's performing beautifully. I am disappointed that they have a dial instead of a touchscreen, but you can't have everything for $300. Plus I added on a Raspberry Pi and camera for OctoPrint so I don't use the screen/dial except for changing filament and leveling the print bed (necessary when you pick up and move the printer, as the level adjust springs are quite soft).`, },
      { userId: 30, printerId: 24, review: `This printer was enjoyable to build (after watching a few assembly videos on YouTube), and produces Excellent results. NOTE: our heated bed is running 5º Cooler than the display indicates, so we have to manually dial in a hotter bed temperature.`, },

I had some problems getting it set up properly, and initially I had given it a three-star rating. However, the seller was a huge help in walking me through troubleshooting the problems, and I am extremely pleased with the outcome.`, },

      { userId: 31, printerId: 1, review: `If you are thinking about getting a 3D printer, I’d say go for it! I bought this ender 3 v2 with the intention to test it out for a month and then decided if I wanted to keep it or not. It took me about 4 days to realize there’s no way I was going to return it! I love 3D printing!!`, },
      { userId: 32, printerId: 2, review: `Warning: you WILL have to tinker with this! There is a lot of tinkering to be done with this printer. Bed leveling, slicer settings, your own designs etc. Don’t go into this thinking that it’s going to be like a regular printer that just always works and prints what you want. But knowing this and having the right mindset can add to the fun! There is something so rewarding when your prints keep messing up and you finally figure out and solve the problem and then you can get back to making great prints!`, },
      { userId: 32, printerId: 3, review: `The printer is mostly quiet. you don’t hear the motors but you do hear the fans. It’s mostly a white noise but it might annoy some people. I put mine in my closet to cut down the noise and I couldn’t hear it at all with the doors closed.`, },
      { userId: 33, printerId: 4, review: `New to this. Got the unit and installed everything. Somewhat vague, poor instructions sheet, but up and going. Disappointed that this is the 4.2.2 board, so it is old stock, and maybe a history given the later problems... Leveling was a bit hard, seemed the bed was uneven - manually moving head around showed high and low spots across the surface (was it a reconditioned machine?). After my first print, OK, I am hooked. I noted one corner of print had problems due to warp, or else, as it had too large a gap despite the 4 pt level being perfect at 60C. Also the leveling mat I printed was very spotty across the surface. So I got the official BLTouch kit. It had three brackets. One, the V2 option, had all the screw holes in the right places, Now, I downloaded and updated firmware to BLTouch version, easy, and tested, it moved around the bed in a 9 pt calibration. But then, it kept hitting and pressing down my bed - had to unplug to get it to stop. Then I noticed the sensor bracket mounted upside down - it never touched the bed. Reinstalled it right side up, it works great.`, },
      { userId: 33, printerId: 5, review: `Having been a Creality 10S user for the last three years I wanted to add a fourth 3D printer but on a smaller scale. I did all the major upgrades from day one. Spent many hours measuring and dialing in the printer so that the uprights and Gantry were dead on. For the life of me that printer would not hold the settings. I needed the printer to print the same STL file over and over and the printer failed over and over. It would either not stick the filament or knock the print over. The printer had the updated Springs, Extruder, Tube, Build plate, etc. Really disappointed. After spending 16 days I had no choice but to send it back...`, },
